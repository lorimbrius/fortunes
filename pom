Apologizing is for the weak and wrong, which is why you should do it to me,

When you hear the night's last flush,
Then my dear it's time to hush.
One or two, either number
Says to you peaceful slumber.
Feel the drench from the broken pipe.
Ooh that stench it's mighty ripe.
So swat the flies,
Close your eyes,
Drift off to my stinky lullaby.
