If skepticism divides the church, vulgarity discolors social living, the profit motive makes industry often cruel, and nationalism blockades the way to peace, do not yes, yes the situation.

The capacity to believe is the most significant and fundamental human faculty, and the most important thing about any man is what he believes in the depth of his being.

To be courageous requires no exceptional qualifications, no magic formula, no special combination of time, place, and circumstance. It is an opportunity that sooner or later is presented to us all. Politics merely furnish one arena which imposes special tests of courage. In whatever arena of life one may meet the challenge of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience-the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, ever the esteem of his fellow men-each man must decide for himself the course he will follow. The stories of past courage can define that ingredient-they can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they can not supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul. -John F. Kennedy

A smile costs nothing but gives much. It riches those who receive, without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory of it sometimes last forever. No man is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it, and no one can be so poor that he can be made rich by it. A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business, and is the countersign of friendship. It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and is natures best antidote for trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give a smile. Give them one of yours, as no one needs a smile so much as he who has none to give. -These Times

The only life worth living is the adventurous life. Of such a life of dominate characteristic is that it is unafraid. It is unafraid of what people think. Like Columbus, it dares not only to assert a belief but live in the face of contrary opinion. It does not adopt either its pace or its objectives to the pace and objectives of its neighbors. It thinks its own thoughts, it reads its own books, it develops its own hobbies, and it is governed by its own conscience. The heard may graze where it pleases, but he who lives the adventurous life will remain unafraid when he finds himself alone. -Raymond B. Fosdick

The point of all this is not to retire from work or you will shrivel up into a nuisance to all mankind. -Brother Senator Dirksen

What is brotherhood? It is the wisdom of Lincoln and the warmth of Gandhi. It is the humility of Jesus, the humbleness of Mohammed, and the humanitarianism of Confucius. It is Catholic and Protestant and Jew living together in peacefulness and harmony. It is Italian and Dane and Bulgarian and Pole working side by side on the job and sitting shoulder to shoulder in the union hall searching for ways to advance the common good. It is the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. It is the Bible, the Talmud, and the Koran. It is the essence of all wisdom of all the ages distilled into a single word. But equally is it the understanding of neighbors and friends who sorrow at your misfortunes and rejoice at your triumph. You can not see brotherhood; neither can you hear it nor taste it. But you can feel it a hundred times a day. It is the pat on the back when things look gloomy. It is the smile of encouragement when the way seems hard. It is the helping hand when the burden becomes unbearable. -Peter E. Trezick

It is not strange that men of note and learning, attracted by the wealth of symbolism on Masonry, as well as by its spirit of fraternity perhaps, also by its secrecy began at an early date to ask to be accepted as members of the order; hence Accepted Masons. How far back the custom of admitting such men to the Lodge goes is not clear, but hints of it are discernable in the oldest documents of the order. -J. F. Newton

The voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be loss, is to sit up cheerfully, and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there.

If we act as if from some better feeling, the bad feeling soon folds its tent like an Arab and silently steals away. -William James

Questions to find an educated man are:
Has your education made you a friend of all good causes?
Has your education made you a brother to the weak?
Do you see anything to love in a little child?
Would a lost dog follow you in the street?
Do you enjoy being alone?
Do you believe in the dignity of labor?
Can you look into a mud puddle and see the blue sky?
Can you go into the night, look up into the sky, and see beyond the stars?
Is your life linked with the Infinite?

When God wants a great work done in the world or a great wrong righted, he goes about it in a very unusual way. He doesn't stir up his earthquakes or send forth his thunderbolts. Instead, he has a helpless baby born, perhaps in a simple home and of some obscure mother. And then God puts the idea into the mother's heart, and she puts it into the baby's mind. And then God waits. The greatest force in the world are not the earthquakes and the thunderbolts. The greatest forces in the world are babies. -E. T. Sullivan

Idleness I just finished reading a delightful book, The Importance of Being Idle, by Stephen Robins, 2000 (Prion [UK], distrib. in US by Trafalgar Square]. The author explained his aims as follows: . . . to make clear the true benefits of sitting around all day doing absolutely nothing whatsoever . .[and] to expose the destructive drudgery of the daily grind.

"The secret of Masonry, like the secret of life, can be known only by those who seek it, serve it, live it.  It cannot be uttered; it can only be felt and acted.

"Freemasonry has endured not because of its antiquity, its influence, or its social standing, but because there have been so many who have lived it.  The effectiveness of Masonic teachings will always be the measure by which the outside world judges Freemasonry; the proof of Freemasonry is in our deeds and it is in our deeds that Freemasonry is made known to non-Masons.  The only way that the Craft can be judged is by its product.  The prestige of Freemasonry lies squarely on the shoulders of each of us."

MASONRY
(Author Unknown)

Masonry is not a secret society. Everybody knows that the Masonic fraternity exists and no effort is made to hide the fact. It is only the wisdom of Masonry which is hidden, not because it is subtle, but because it is simple. Its secret is profound; not obscure.
In the quiet of the lodge, in an air of reverence and friendship, it teaches us the truth that makes us men, and upon which faith and character must rest.
What is secret in Freemasonry? The method of its teaching, the atmosphere it creates, the spirit in our hearts and the ties it weaves between men. The secret of Masonry, like the secret of life, can only be known by those who seek it. It cannot be uttered, it can only be felt and acted. For that reason no one need be alarmed about any book written to expose Masonry. It is utterly harmless.
The real secrets of Freemasonry cannot be learned by prying eyes or by curious inquiry. The secrets of Masonry can be known only by those who are ready and worthy to receive it. Only a pure heart and honest mind can know it.
If Masonry uses the illusion of secrecy, it is because it knows that it is the nature of man to seek what is hidden. We are seekers after truth and God has so made us that we cannot find the truth alone, but only in the love and service of our fellow man.
Here is the real secret and to learn it is to have the key to the meaning and joy of life.

"There is not a subject so little understood by even its own members as that of Freemasonry.  It is not in the strict sense an order.  Its purpose is more clearly defined when it is called a fraternity, a brotherhood, or an institution.  It is certainly not a club.  Ritualism is not Masonry.  The ritual is the vehicle which conveys the sublime truths to the heart and mind.  If the forms and ceremonies through which the candidate passes fail to lift him to higher conceptions of life, duty and charity, then they are mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbal."

"The steps taken by the candidate -- initiation, passing and raising -- are, of course, important to the candidate, but of the elements of the degree, the explanatory lecture, is where we who are in charge of making Masons let the candidate down.  The lecture is the educational part of the degree.  We give it to the candidate immediately following a very emotionally draining experience when a good nap is uppermost in his mind. (This after loading him up with a Salisbury steak dinner).  Shouldn't this educational process be developed into a different delivery system?
Brethren -- there is confusion in the temple.  We oppose the One day class as a matter of principal.  We worry about solicitation.  We worry about dues.  We worry, worry, worry! Why don't we worry about educating Masons in a meaningful way!"

"Do you know why you are requested to raise your right hand when taking an oath?  In ancient times people born in slavery were branded on the palm of the right hand and were not entitled to the privilege of taking an oath.  The right hand was raised to show the administering official whether or not the palm was branded.  If not marked, the person was freeborn and eligible to take an oath."

"A society without standards will be a society without stability and it will one day go down.  Not only nations but whole civilizations have perished in the past for lack of righteousness.

It is the symbol of that moral law upon which life must be based if it is to continue."

"In 1861 a Pennsylvania minister wrote to Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, suggesting a recognition of God on our coins.  'In God We Trust' first appeared on the 1864 copper 2-cent piece when Congress authorized a new denomination with whatever legend Chase deemed appropriate.  It was added to the quarter and most larger denominations in 1866 but not on the cent until 1909.  In the mid-1950's Congress ordered the motto added to paper money."

"Freemasonry is an attempt to organize harmony, and therefore it is essential that all its arrangements for the promotion of concord should be of the most perfect character and most delicately adjusted. Whatever tends in the least degree to produce disagreement and discord, to cause a jarring and clashing among the elements composing the society, or any of its branches, must have a tendency to defeat the purposes of the Institution, must in itself be destructive of the spirit of Masonry, and must be something foreign to that spirit, something not to be cultivated, but to be avoided by Masons.
Masons are supposed by the profane to be religiously devoted to the maintenance among themselves of harmonic principles, and this supposition is based upon the professions which Masons and Masonic writers and advocates have ever made to the world. The supposition is well-grounded, and the profession does not exaggerate the intention of all true Masons."

"There is a certain grave beauty in the practice of Masonic etiquette. The Masonic life as it is lived out in our assemblies is a conscious work of art, with each and every part coordinated to every other, and instinct with the feeling of the whole; if a man enters into that system without preparation or forethought, and trusting only his instincts, his manner will strike an awkward note, like a discord jangling across a strain of music; but if he has trained himself in his part and caught the spirit of the whole, the genius of Freemasonry will shine through his actions, will express itself through ritual, symbol, law, philosophy, fellowship and daily deed. To have one's self thus become a part of a great and living whole is a kind of satisfying pleasure nothing else can give, a participation in the very life of beauty, appreciated as much by the beholders as by the actor. This ability to confer pleasure upon one's fellows when gathered in communication or in ceremony is not the least of etiquette's rewards."

"There are five different approaches to Masonry and only five.  The Historical approach; the Philosophical approach; the Psychological approach; the Ethical approach; and the Ritualistic approach.  There are no other approaches to Freemasonry. Now, we have stressed the historical approach; we have spent thousands and thousands of dollars; that is very important.  We ... have spent thousands and thousands stressing ritualistic approach.  But, my brethren, the most important approach - and I venture the assertion here we haven't spent one cent on it - is the ethical approach to Freemasonry.  Why?  Because Freemasonry is a way of life.   I hope to live long enough, my brethren, to see as much emphasis placed on it as there is upon the historical approach and the ritualistic approach, important as they are."

Let us separate the Square from the Compasses and study it alone, the better to understand its meaning and use. There is no need to say that the Square we have in mind is not a Cube, which has six equal faces and 12 perfect angles, deemed by the Greeks "a figure of perfection". Nor is it the square of the carpenter, one leg of which is longer than the other, with indices marked thereon for measuring. It is a small, plain Square, unmarked and with legs of equal length, a simple tri-square used for testing the accuracy of angles, and the precision with which stones are cut.

IMMORTALITY

["A belief in immortality did not begin with Freemasonry... Below are examples of how other men have felt about immortality.

Parmenides of Elea, 515-440 B.C.: 'Being is without beginning and indestructible. It is universal and without end. It is altogether, one, and continuous. '

Plato, 427-347 B.C.: .'Every soul is immortal, for whatever is in perpetual motion is immortal.'

Apollonius of Tyana - Greek philosopher of 1st century A.D.: 'There is no death of anything save in appearance.'

St. Augustine, 354-439 A.D.: 'Neither the soul nor the human body suffers complete annihilation. '

St. Thomas Aquinas, 1225-1274 A.D.: 'The soul exists independent of the body, and continues after the body dies, taking on a new spiritual body. '

Goethe, 1749-1832 AD. - German poet, philosopher and scientist: 'I am convinced that the soul is indestructible and that its activity will continue through eternity. It is like the sun, which to our eyes seems to set at night, but has in reality only gone to diffuse its light elsewhere. '

Einstein's Relativity Theory: 'Matter can never be destroyed ... but it can be changed into other forms of energy'

The Talmud: 'No atom of matter in the whole vastness of the universe is lost.  How then can man's soul, which comprises the whole world in one idea, be lost?' .

Socrates speaking in Plato's Phaedo: 'If the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity?'

Thus Masonic education is the foundation for our Fraternity.
