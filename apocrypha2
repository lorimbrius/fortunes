But sometimes there were two pairs of
footprints, and sometimes there was only
one. And the times when there was only
one pair of footprints, those were my
times of greatest trouble.
So I asked the Goddess, 'Why, in my greatest need, did you abandon me?'
She replied, 'I never left you. Those
were the times when we both hopped on one
foot.' And lo, I was really embarassed
for bothering Her with such a stupid question.

Schrodinger's cat and Wigner's friend
Cause us problems without end
The cat is both alive and dead
In math that's in our head
And the regression of Von Neumann
Never ceases to annoy Man
The uncertainty just has no end
Until Wigner goes to tell his friend
For, until the friend receives the news
That the cat still purrs and mews
The cat remains (suspended Fate!)
In some formal Eigenstate

But if Wigner makes a beeline
To report the now-dead feline
All the friend can really know
Is just one branch of time's swift flow
For in Carter's multispace
Every time-brance has its place
So the cat remains alive
In the half cases (That's .5)
Lead us not to Copenhagen
Nor to Shylock, nor to Fagin

Yet I find it quite harmonious
